Abstract
In this paper, we aim to study millimeter-wave-based gait recognition in complex indoor environments, focusing on dealing with multipath ghosts and supporting rapid deployment to new environments. We design a ghost detection algorithm based on velocity change patterns. This algorithm relies solely on velocity estimation, requiring no environmental priors or multipath modeling. Hence, it is suitable for single-chip millimeter-wave radar with low angular resolution and can be conveniently deployed in new indoor settings. In addition, we build a gait recognition network based on an attention-based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to extract spatiotemporal-velocity features from RD heatmaps.
We have evaluated RDGait in two scenarios: a corridor scenario and a crowded office scenario, with 125 volunteers of different genders and ages ranging from 6 to 63. RDGait achieves a user recognition accuracy exceeding 95% among 125 candidates in both scenarios. We have further deployed RDGait in two additional scenarios using the pretrain-finetune approach. With minimal user registration data, RDGait could achieve satisfactory (> 90%) recognition accuracy in these new environments considering different radar placements, heights, and number of co-existing users.

Radar Target Recognition Based on Complex HRRP Using Convolutional Neural Network
SSPS '19: Proceedings of the 2019 International Symposium on Signal Processing Systems
Owing to the initial phase of the complex high resolution range profile (HRRP) is sensitive, real HRRP is usually used in the radar automatic target recognition (RATR) field, which partially causes losing information of the data. Based on this, this ...
